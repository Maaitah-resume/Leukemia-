Leukemia cancer segmentation 
üß¨ Leukemia Cell Segmentation using Deep Learning

This project applies advanced deep learning architectures to automatically segment leukemia cells from microscopic blood images, aiming to support early medical diagnosis and clinical image analysis.

üîç Overview

I trained and evaluated multiple semantic segmentation models ‚Äî U-Net, Feature Pyramid Network (FPN), Pyramid Scene Parsing Network (PSPNet), and DeepLabV3 ‚Äî all built on a ResNet50 encoder.
Each model was tested with different optimizers (Adam, SGD, RMSProp) and learning configurations to identify the best-performing setup.
